    "# Example Usage of BERT Question Answering Model\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use the BERT Question Answering model with various inputs and settings. The model is pre-trained and fine-tuned on the SQuAD dataset, which makes it suitable for answering questions based on a given passage of text.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "First, we need to install and import the required libraries.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from transformers import BertForQuestionAnswering, BertTokenizer\n",
    "import torch\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Load the Pre-trained Model and Tokenizer\n",
    "We'll load the BERT model and tokenizer, which are fine-tuned for question answering.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Load the pre-trained model and tokenizer\n",
    "model = BertForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained('bert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking-finetuned-squad')\n",
    "tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking-finetuned-squad')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Define the Question Answering Function\n",
    "The function `bert_question_answer` will use the BERT model to find the answer to a given question based on the passage.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def bert_question_answer(question, passage, max_len=500):\n",
    "    # Tokenize the input question and passage\n",
    "    input_ids = tokenizer.encode(question, passage, max_length=max_len, truncation=True)\n",
    "    sep_index = input_ids.index(tokenizer.sep_token_id)\n",
    "    len_question = sep_index + 1\n",
    "    len_passage = len(input_ids) - len_question\n",
    "    segment_ids = [0] * len_question + [1] * len_passage\n",
    "    tokens = tokenizer.convert_ids_to_tokens(input_ids)\n",
    "    start_token_scores = model(torch.tensor([input_ids]))[0].detach().numpy().flatten()\n",
    "    end_token_scores = model(torch.tensor([input_ids]))[1].detach().numpy().flatten()\n",
    "    answer_start_index = np.argmax(start_token_scores)\n",
    "    answer_end_index = np.argmax(end_token_scores)\n",
    "    answer = tokens[answer_start_index]\n",
    "    for i in range(answer_start_index + 1, answer_end_index + 1):\n",
    "        if tokens[i].startswith('##'):\n",
    "            answer += tokens[i][2:]\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            answer += ' ' + tokens[i]\n",
    "    if start_token_scores[answer_start_index] < 0 or answer_start_index == 0 or answer_end_index < answer_start_index or answer == '[SEP]':\n",
    "        answer = 'Sorry!, I was unable to discover an answer in the passage.'\n",
    "    return answer\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example 1: Basic Usage\n",
    "Try answering a question based on a short passage.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Define a passage and question\n",
    "passage = \"Hello, I am Ishwar. My friend name is Ajay. He is the son of Kristen. I spend most of the time with Ajay.\"\n",
    "question = \"What is my name\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Get the answer\n",
    "answer = bert_question_answer(question, passage)\n",
    "print(f'Answer: {answer}')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example 2: Longer Passage\n",
    "Try answering a question based on a more detailed passage.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Define a longer passage and question\n",
    "passage = \"Natural language processing, or NLP, is the study of interactions between computers and humans using natural language.\"\n",
    "question = \"What is NLP\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Get the answer\n",
    "answer = bert_question_answer(question, passage)\n",
    "print(f'Answer: {answer}')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example 3: Complex Questions\n",
    "Try answering more complex questions.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Define a complex passage and question\n",
    "passage = \"Natural language processing (NLP) involves multiple tasks like sentiment analysis, translation, and summarization.\"\n",
    "question = \"What tasks does NLP involve?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Get the answer\n",
    "answer = bert_question_answer(question, passage)\n",
    "print(f'Answer: {answer}')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "This notebook demonstrated how to use the BERT Question Answering model for different types of questions and passages. Adjust the `max_len` parameter for handling longer passages as needed."
